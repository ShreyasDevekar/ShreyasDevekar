>**“A test doesn’t just verify, it listens. It listens to the product, to the code, and to the chaos users never report.”**


**Testing isn’t only about checking if a feature works. Good tests detects patterns, anomalies, and silent failures — like a diagnostic tool rather than a checkbox. It’s about paying attention to how the system behaves, not just what it outputs. Many bugs don’t come through formal bug reports — they exist silently in logs, in edge cases, or in things users just live with. A great test strategy anticipates hidden risks, not just the obvious ones.**

#### About Me

I’m Shreyas Devekar, and I engineer quality not by chasing bugs, but by tracing the story behind every failure. My job as a SDET isn’t to break things—it’s to ensure what’s built has the resilience to withstand reality. I am building **robust test automation frameworks**, solving real-world QA challenges, and ensuring **software works just as well in production as it does in theory**. Whether it’s UI, API, mobile, or CI/CD pipelines — I bring **structure to the chaos** of modern development with clean, scalable test strategies.
